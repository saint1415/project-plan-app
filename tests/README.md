# Tests

This directory contains all automated tests for the Project Plan App. A strong testing suite helps ensure reliability, prevent bugs, and make future development easier.

## Structure

- `/unit/` — Unit tests for individual functions, utilities, or components.
- `/integration/` — Tests that check how different modules or components work together.
- `/e2e/` — End-to-end tests that simulate real user scenarios and interactions with the app.

## Running Tests

To run all tests, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm test
