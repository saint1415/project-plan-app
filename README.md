# Project Plan App

AI-powered project planning tool designed for project managers. This application aims to streamline the project planning process by providing structured sections, AI-powered content suggestions, and robust export capabilities. It's built with scalability in mind, allowing for future integration of advanced features like collaboration, cloud storage, and version control.

## Features (Planned)

### Core Functionality
- **Structured Project Sections:** Comprehensive forms for all key project plan components (e.g., Project Overview, Objectives, Scope, Stakeholders, Timeline, Budget, Risks, Communication Plan, Deliverables, Success Criteria).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:** "Suggest with AI" button for each section to provide context-aware content generation, examples, and best practices. This will leverage external AI services (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) by pre-configuring prompts and copying text to the clipboard for user convenience.
- **Multi-Format Export:** Ability to export the complete project plan into various formats including PDF, Microsoft Word (.docx), Markdown, and Excel (.xlsx) for easy sharing and documentation.
- **Local Save & Load:** Functionality to save and load project plans directly from the user's browser storage or via file download/upload, ensuring data persistence.

### Advanced Features (Future Expansion)
- **Templates & Customization:** Create, save, and load reusable project plan templates. Allow users to add, remove, or reorder sections to fit specific project needs or methodologies.
- **Collaboration:** Implement features for multiple users to work on the same project plan, either through real-time editing or file-based sharing mechanisms.
- **Version History:** Track changes made to project plans over time, enabling users to review revisions and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Seamless integration with popular cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for saving, loading, and syncing project plans.
- **Direct AI API Integration:** Transition from clipboard-based AI suggestions to direct API calls for a more integrated and streamlined AI experience (requires API keys and backend considerations).
- **User Accounts:** Implement an authentication system for user accounts, allowing for personalized settings, secure storage of plans, and access to premium features.
- **Analytics & Insights:** Gather anonymous usage data to understand feature adoption and identify areas for improvement, or provide users with insights into their planning habits.
- **Localization:** Support for multiple languages to cater to a global user base.
